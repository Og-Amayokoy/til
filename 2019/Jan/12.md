```
var fs = WScript.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
```

Create new .txt file
```
var file = fs.CreateTextFile("filename.txt");//"filename" is what you want decide name
```

Add text to .txt
```
file.Write("text");//"text" is what you want write on .txt file
```

#### You must close it.
Close file
```
file.Close();
```
